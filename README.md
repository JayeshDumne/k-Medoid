## PAMAE: PArallel k-Medoids clustering with high Accuracy and Efficiency

The k-medoids algorithm is one of the best-known clustering algorithms. Despite this, however, it is not as widely used for big-data analytics as the k-means algorithm, mainly because of its high computational complexity. A lot of research has tried to solve the efficiency problem of the k-medoids algorithm, but all of it improves efficiency at the expense of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel k-medoids algorithm, which we call **PAMAE**, that achieves both high accuracy and high efficiency. We identify two factors--"**global search**" and "**entire data**"--which are essential to achieve high accuracy, but very time consuming if considered at the same time. Thus, our key idea is to apply them **one-by-one** through two phases, neither of which is costly. In order to validate the merit of our approach, we implement PAMAE on Spark as well as Hadoop and conduct extensive experiments, using various real-world and synthetic data sets, on twelve Microsoft Azure machines. The results show that PAMAE significantly reduces clustering error to as little as 0.51~6.8% of the errors in state-of-the-art algorithms, while increasing execution time by only 18~30%.
